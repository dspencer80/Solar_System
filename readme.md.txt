Set up and use a virtual environment instructions:
- Install Anaconda
- Open Anaconda prompt
- Type "conda create -n "Name of environment"" (Mine was myVEn)
- When asked to proceed type "y"
- Go to folder where Anaconda is installed on your system and you should see the virtual environment you just created
- Next you will type "activate "the name of your VE"
- Then type "activate base" and then type "conda.bat activate base"
- Here you can type "python --version" and it will show you the version of Python you have in the VE
- Virtual Environments are useful if your software needs an earlier version of Python to run
