COMPARING THE SIZES OF THE PLANETS

Welcome to my project. After doing this project I have learned some skills that I never thought I could learn. My project uses two similar datasets that look similar but use different datatypes to present data to the user. I used these two datasets to compare the sizes of the planets in the solar system. I felt like I had to use Pluto because I have always wished they would restore it as a planet. I used the information in the datasets to compare the planets based on the diameter of each. You will clearly see that some planets are vastly bigger than others. Other than that, this project doesn't do much. It's as simple as it gets.

CSV files used for this project:

planets.csv
planets1.csv

The following packages need to be installed to run:
Anaconda 2022.10
ipykernel 6.15.2
jupyter 1.0.0
matplotlib 3.5.2
numpy 1.21.5
pandas 1.4.4
plotly 5.9.0
python 3.9.13
seaborn 0.11.2
pillow 9.2.0
ipython 7.31.1

Instructions to run:(the way I did it)
Install Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook
Install Python

Clone the Repository
 
-- in the command prompt type "git clone <https://github.com/dspencer80/Solar_System.git>

-- the repository will then be cloned to your local machine

Create a virtual machine by doing the following:

-- Install Anaconda
-- Open Anaconda prompt
-- Type "conda create -n "Name of environment"" (Mine was myVEn)
-- When asked to proceed type "y"
-- Go to folder where Anaconda is installed on your system and you should see the virtual environment you just created
-- Next you will type "activate "the name of your VE"
-- Then type "activate base" and then type "conda.bat activate base"
-- Here you can type "python --version" and it will show you the version of Python you have in the VE

Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file


Requirements Met:

Feature 1 -- Read in two csv files to create dataframe
Feature 2 -- Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.  
Feature 3 -- Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn
Feature 4 -- Utilize a virtual environment and included instructions in this README on how the user should set one up
Feature 5 -- Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.





Set up and use a virtual environment instructions:
- Install Anaconda
- Open Anaconda prompt
- Type "conda create -n "Name of environment"" (Mine was myVEn)
- When asked to proceed type "y"
- Go to folder where Anaconda is installed on your system and you should see the virtual environment you just created
- Next you will type "activate "the name of your VE"
- Then type "activate base" and then type "conda.bat activate base"
- Here you can type "python --version" and it will show you the version of Python you have in the VE
- Virtual Environments are useful if your software needs an earlier version of Python to run
